# MedievalMining – Developer Portfolio Overview

## Project Summary

**MedievalMining** is an advanced Minecraft plugin created to simulate historical nation-building and city-state economies, inspired by 1500s global powers. Designed and built by Brandon Hilliard as a hands-on learning and portfolio project during his Bachelor of Science in Network Engineering and Security at WGU.

This project demonstrates the integration of economic logic, NPC AI behavior, city simulation, and multiplayer systems using Java and Spigot/Paper APIs.

## Key Features

- **City & Nation Auto-Generation**: Historical capitals auto-generate with custom names, currencies, and trade zones
- **NPC Worker AI**: Farmers, Miners, Merchants, Guards, Builders, and Caravaners with resource-driven job behavior
- **Dynamic Market Economy**: Floating prices, currency enforcement, city treasuries, and inventory tracking
- **Trade and Territory**: Cities expand via claimed chunks, set economic policies, and trade with neighbors
- **Player + NPC World Interaction**: Designed to support both survival play and autonomous NPC nation simulation

## Technologies Used

- **Java 17**
- **Spigot/Paper API**
- **Vault**, **Citizens2**, **Dynmap**
- **YAML for data persistence**
- **Maven project structure**
- **This project was developed with educational support and technical guidance from AI tools (ChatGPT-4), used to assist with planning, formatting, and debugging.**
